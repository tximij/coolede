The latest programme was dedicated to England. I had an opportunity to see old castles, learn their long history and get acquainted with their inhabitants. As I am fond of the Beatles, I wanted to know something new about the most success¬ful pop group the world has ever known. The Beatles have always been in the news headlines, films and sometimes scandal. Their song «Love Me Do», which in 1962 entered the British hit Parade, in 1982, was again i
n the Top Ten! A lot of people still long tor the music of the Beatles, the music of freedom and piece. 
The next programme will be dedicated to the USA. I hope to learn something about Elvis Presley, who influenced the
famous Lennon and McCartney early songs.
